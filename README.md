For my personal usage, you can reference it and modify everything by yourself.

Work on PowerShell 7.1(PowerShell Core)  
Some feature maybe not work on PowerShell 5.1 (Win10 default powershell)  

## For [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)

```PowerShell
git clone "git@github.com:chencyu/powershell-profile.git" "$HOME\Documents\PowerShell"
# enjoy!
```

## For PowerShell 5.1

```PowerShell
# Launch PowerShell with administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

and

```PowerShell
git clone "git@github.com:chencyu/powershell-profile.git" "$HOME\Documents\PowerShell"
# enjoy!
```
